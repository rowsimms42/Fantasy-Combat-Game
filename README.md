# Fantasy-Combat-Game

The game universe contains Vampire, Barbarian, Blue Men, Medusa, and Harry Potter. Each character has attributes of attack, defense, armor, and strength points. Each round consists of two attacks, one for each character. For each attack, attacker and defender both generate dice rolls. Each combat between 2 characters ends when one of the characters die.

The table containing the attributes data is shown below.
Note: “1d12” means rolling one 12-sided die, and “2d6” means rolling 2 6-sided dice, etc.


Type----------Attack------Defense-----------Armor---------------Strength Points

Vampire-------1d12--------1d6*Charm----------1------------------18

Barbarian-----2d6---------2d6----------------0------------------12

Blue Men------2d10--------3d-----------------3------------------12 *Mob

Medusa--------2d6* Glare--1d6----------------3------------------8

Harry Potter--2d6---------2d6----------------0------------------10/20*Hogwarts



The characters also have their own characteristics as well as special abilities:


Vampire

Characteristics: Suave, debonair, but vicious and surprisingly resilient.

Charm: Vampires can charm an opponent into not attacking. For a given attack there is a 50% chance that their opponent does not actually attack them.
               

Barbarian

Characteristics: Think Conan or Hercules from the movies. Big sword, big muscles, bare torso.

Charm: None
 

Blue Men

Characteristics: They are small, 6 inch tall, but fast and tough. They are hard to hit so they can take some damage. They can also do a LOT of damage when they crawl inside enemies’ armor or clothing.

Charm: Mob: Blue Men are actually a swarm of small individuals. For every 4 points of damage, they lose one defense die. For example, if they have a strength of 8, they would have 2d6 for defense.


Medusa

Characteristics: Scrawny lady with snakes for hair which helps her during combat. Just don’t look at her!

Charm: Glare: If a Medusa rolls a 12 when attacking then the target instantly gets turned into stone and Medusa wins! If Medusa uses Glare on Harry Potter on his first life, then Harry Potter comes back to life.


Harry Potter

Characteristics:  Harry Potter is a wizard.

Charm: Hogwarts: If Harry Potter's strength reaches 0 or below, he immediately recovers and his total strength becomes 20. If he were to die again, then he’s dead.

Note:

If Medusa uses “glare” on Harry Potter on his first life, then Harry Potter comes back to life after using “hogwarts”.
If the Vampire’s “charm” ability activates when Medusa uses “glare”, the Vampire’s charm trumps Medusa’s glare.
